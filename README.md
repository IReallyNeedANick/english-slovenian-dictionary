This is incomplete english - slovenian dictionary in json

I am in process of creating one so this is still in TODO (missing all words from dispatching - firing pin)

I started with all the words for english-german as it seemed the biggest from this webpage https://blog.jirivanek.eu/en/2023/11/24/dictionaries-for-the-onyx-boox-e-reader/

all_words is ideal scenario where all the words will be in eng_slo.json eventually. file has been taken from here: https://github.com/words/an-array-of-english-words

you can make a stardict from this if you run file stardict_converter
